day1- drawing images and setting some basic grid mechanics
day2- complete row and column states
day3- bug solving about highlighting circles and sticks
day4- more bug solving and polishing

most challengic thing for me;
the calculations when a connection point is in a completed situation multiple times by 
its surrounding neighboring connection points and one of these completed spots is cleared.
